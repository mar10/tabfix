Cleanup whitespace in text files:

- Unify indentation by replacing leading tabs with spaces (or vice versa)
- Strip trailing whitespace
- Make sure the file ends with exactly one line break
- Unify line delimiters to Unix, Windows, or Mac style
- Optionally change indentation depth


This GitHub version is an exploration clone of the original project on Google Code:
